I never realized how much of an impact coding has had on me. Learning something new does make a difference. Right now, I have built websites, apps, and will finish a clone of Airbnb. What more could you want. The thought of putting my projects on my github never really hit me because I thought people would judge and make fun. It is the total opposite, everywhere I have turned for advice, people are telling you how many ways we can solve one problem as a community. I'm happy to be apart of an awesome industry.
